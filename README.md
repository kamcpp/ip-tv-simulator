ip-tv-simulator
===============

A simulation written in C++ used for simulating IP TV anthenas in
a highway. These IP TV anthenas located in highway are used for 
sharing TV channels and car passengers use them to watch TV channels. 
Current implementation uses a specific handshake explained in an 
algorithm called Pre-Acquired Channel. In this algorithm, anethnas 
talks to each other and informs the others for incoming cars.
